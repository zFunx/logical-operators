## Test cases (Complex to simple)
1. Create an OR operation. This will add two constants with FALSE values. Add AND operation as an operand of our OR operation. Add an argument `My Arg` in addition to two default FALSE constants in our AND operation. Toggle all operands of AND operations to TRUE. Result will be TRUE.

1. Create an OR operation. This will add two constants with FALSE values. Add an argument `My Arg`. Toggle the value of the argument. Result will be TRUE or FALSE depending the value of `My Arg`.
1. Create an OR operation. This will add two constants with FALSE values. Toggle one of the constants to TRUE. Click on the operator name to toggle the operator from OR to AND to OR. Result will be TRUE for the OR operation and FALSE for the AND operation
